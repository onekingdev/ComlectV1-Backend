          p.fw-700 INFORMATION COLLECTION

          p Complect, and any third parties acting under Complect’s authorization, will not collect any personal information about you except when specifically and knowingly provided by you. Examples of such information are your name, email address, location, phone number, credit card or bank account information, and other information about your Business or professional background. Examples of ways in which we may collect such information from you include the following:

          p.fw-700 A. Personally Identifying Information

          p <strong>Account Sign-Up</strong>. Before using certain parts of this Site, you must complete a sign-up form. When signing up, you will be prompted to provide certain personal information, depending on the applicable sign-up form, including, but not limited to, your name, company name, email address, and phone number.  In addition, you may also be asked to provide your country of residence, so we can comply with applicable laws and regulations. Such personal information is used to provide Complect with information about your experience, to communicate with you about this Site, and for internal data modeling.  The information is not used for third-party marketing purposes.

          p <strong>Email Addresses</strong>. Some areas of the Site allow you to enter your email address for purposes including, but not limited to: registering for a particular service or activity, or opening a Complect account.  If you choose not to provide your email address when prompted, you may not be able to engage in some or all of those activities.

          p <strong>Information from Social Media</strong>.  If you access or log-in to a Complect service through a social media website or other non-Complect service, or connect a Complect service to a social media website or other non-Complect service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service.

          p.fw-700 B. Non-Personally Identifying Information

          p <strong>Personal Information</strong>. We may collect other information that you provide in connection with your use of the Services (e.g., zip code (on its own) and individual preferences) (“Non-Identifying Information”). We collect additional Non-Identifying Information from Businesses in the form of information related to projects posted via the Service (e.g., budget, payment structure, location, description of the project, feedback/rating information). We also collect additional Non-Identifying Information from Specialists in connection with Specialist profiles (e.g., educational information, work experience, skills, etc.)

          p <strong>Log information</strong>.  When you access the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website.

Complect does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.

          p <strong>Cookies</strong>. Like most other websites, Complect uses cookie technology throughout this Site. A cookie is a small removable data file that is stored by your web browser on your computer which often includes an anonymous unique identifier.  Complect uses both session cookies (to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Site) and persistent cookies (to save your email address and password for future logins to the Site and to track your compliance with our Terms of Use) on this Site; session cookies expire at the end of a particular visit to our Site, while persistent cookies (also called stored cookies) remain active until you disable them through your browser settings, or until a pre-set expiration date.

          p.fw-700 INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

          p <strong>Specialists</strong>. Your Specialist profile will be created if you complete our Specialist sign up form, you meet the eligibility criteria and you choose to use the Services as a Specialist.  The Specialist profile may include information including, but not limited to, name, location, skills, educational information, work experience, certifications/licenses and rating/review information. You may edit your Specialist profile via the Edit link when logged in and viewing your profile. Your profile will not be publicly viewable via the Site and your profile will only be searchable by Businesses if you elect for your profile to be public either when signing up or through the Dashboard. If you elect for your profile to be private, it will not be shared with any users of the Complect Platform (other than employees of Complect), and no other Specialists or Businesses will be able to view your profile or know that your profile exists unless you ask a question on, or apply for, a Project or Full-Time Role, or contribute to the discussion forum. In all circumstances, your last name, contact information and resume will not be displayed unless you apply for a Project or Full-Time Role, in which case the Business whose Project or Full-Time Role you applied for may have access to your full name and resume. Complect users who are not registered (for example those just browsing the Site without logging in) will not be able to view your Specialist Profile.

          p <strong>Businesses</strong>. If you submit our Business sign up form and you choose to use the Services as a Business, your Business profile will be created. The Business profile may include information including, but not limited to the Business name, location, industry, regulatory jurisdictions, number of employees, a business description, key contact name or key contact job title, and rating/review information. You may edit your Business profile via the Edit link when logged in and viewing your profile. Your profile will not be publicly viewable via the Site and your profile will not be searchable by Specialists. Your profile will not be shared with any users of the Complect Platform (other than employees of Complect) and no other Specialists or Businesses will be able to view your profile or know that your profile exists unless you post a Project or Full-Time Role, or contribute to the discussion forum. When you sign up, you may elect for your profile to be anonymous, in which case only your industry, number of employees, jurisdiction and business description will be displayed on the Complect Platform. Your anonymity can be changed through your Dashboard. Despite your anonymity, when you engage a Specialist for a Project or hire a Specialist for a Full-Time Role, that Specialist will have access to your full business name. Complect users who are not registered (for example those just browsing the Site without logging in) will not be able to view your Business Profile.

          p If you choose to post a Project or a Full-Time Role via the Services as a Business, the contents of such Project or Full-Time Role listing will be viewable via the Site, but only to registered Specialists and Businesses. Project or Full-Time Role Listings may include information such as budget, salary, location, industry, jurisdiction, payment structure, required years of experience, other required skills or certifications, a description of the Project or Full-Time Role, a brief description of the Business, and Business ratings and reviews.

          p If you conduct any transaction that requires a payment or receipt of funds by you, some of your details may be provided to a third party payment processor to allow the transaction to be completed.

          p.fw-700 PROTECTING YOUR INFORMATION

          p Our servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an advanced encryption technology that works with most internet browsers.

          p SSL is considered the industry standard and is among the leading software available to encrypt online transactions.  Your personal information is encrypted so that it cannot be read as it is transmitted over the internet.  Regardless of these efforts, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  Therefore, any information you transmit to us is sent at your own risk.
          p Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority for Complect. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.

          p.fw-700 NON-US INFORMATION

          p Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.  If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to Complect, you agree that we may transfer such information to the United States and process it there, and that it may be accessed by Complect staff and third parties working for Complect inside the United States. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

          p.fw-700 CHANGING YOUR INFORMATION OR DELETING YOUR ACCOUNT

          p All registered users of the Complect Platform may review, update, correct or delete the information in their profile by making edits via their accounts. If you completely delete all such information, then your account may become deactivated.  If you would like to delete your account, you can do so through the Account Settings section of the Site; however, your personal information may remain in our archives. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes. Note that neither you nor Complect can delete all copies of information that has been previously shared with other users on the Complect Platform.

          p.fw-700 PROJECT DASHBOARD

          p If and when a Business hires a Specialist for a particular Project, the Project will be launched and a Project Dashboard will be generated. This Project Dashboard will contain information from the profiles of both the Business and the Specialist who are engaged on the Project, including but not limited to, names and details about the project. The Project Dashboard will also contain a messaging platform, the ability to share documents, and, where applicable, an hourly timesheet module. The Project Dashboard will only be viewable by the Business who has posted the Project, and the Specialist who has been engaged for the Project. Complect administrators will only have access to the Project Dashboard if an issue is escalated to us via the Help tab of the Project Dashboard. Project Dashboards will be locked for editing once a Project has been completed but the information will be archived and remain accessible by the relevant Business and Specialist so long as they have an active Account.

          p.fw-700 RATINGS AND REVIEWS

          p At the end of each Project, we collect ratings and reviews from users about their experience with other users of the Services. Any feedback you provide via the Services will be viewable via the Services. Businesses will be able to view the ratings and reviews of Specialists who have public profiles or who have applied to a Project or Full-Time Role posting by the Business. Specialists will be able to view the ratings and reviews of Businesses who have posted a Project or Full-Time Role. All ratings and reviews will be displayed via the Business or Specialist profile and you will be able to see your ratings and reviews in your Dashboard.

          p.fw-700 SERVICE PROVIDERS

          p We may employ third party companies and individuals to host the Services, to provide the Services on Complect’s behalf, to improve the Services and to perform Site-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, payment processing, fraud detection and improvement of the Site’s features) or to assist us in analyzing how the Site and Services are used. These third parties have access to your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

          p.fw-700 LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES

          p The Site may contain links to third party websites.  If you choose to click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
