            strong Disputes With Other Users
            p You are solely responsible for your interactions with users of the Site and the Complect Platform, and any other parties with whom you interact on or through the Site, the Complect Platform and/or the Linked Sites.  Complect reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with these disputes.  To the extent that Complect offers assistance in resolving such disputes, such assistance will be informal in nature and not legally binding on the parties.  In the event that a party refuses to cooperate or comply in connection with a Complect-assisted dispute recommendation, each party shall have the right to pursue any and all legal actions and remedies available under applicable law.
            ol.ol-numerals
              li <strong>Informal Process First.</strong> You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Complect, you will first contact us and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to arbitration under this Agreement.
              li <strong>Binding Arbitration.</strong> You and Complect mutually agree that any dispute or claim between them that remains unresolved after the informal dispute resolution described in section 20(b)(i) will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than by court or jury trial. This arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) and applies to any and all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, this arbitration agreement, your use of the Site, your status as an independent contractor, your provision of services through use of the Site and all other aspects of your relationship (including the cessation of your relationship) with Complect, past, present or future, whether arising under federal, state or local statutory and/or common law. You and Complect agree that the mutual obligations to arbitrate disputes provide adequate consideration for this arbitration agreement.
              li <strong>No Judge or Jury.</strong> There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would.
              li <strong>Arbitrator and Rules.</strong> The arbitration will be conducted before a neutral single arbitrator, whose decision will be final and binding. Unless the parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator shall be an attorney experienced in the law in the underlying dispute and licensed to practice law in the state of New York, or a former judge from any jurisdiction.  The arbitral proceedings will be governed by the American Arbitration Association Commercial Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”), Consumer Due Process Protocol, and Supplementary Procedures for Resolution of Consumer Related Disputes. These rules can be found on the American Arbitration Association website at www.adr.org. Unless the parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator shall be an attorney experienced in the law in the underlying dispute and licensed to practice law in the state of New York, or a former judge from any jurisdiction.
              li <strong>Starting an Arbitration.</strong> To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send us a notice of dispute, in writing and within the applicable statute of limitations period, setting forth your name, address and contact information, the facts of the dispute and relief requested. You must send your notice of legal dispute to us at the following address: help@complect.co. Complect will send any notice of dispute to you at the contact information we have for you. The arbitrator will resolve all disputes regarding the timeliness or propriety of the demand for arbitration.
              li <strong>Format of Proceedings.</strong> The arbitration will be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions.
              li <strong>Fees.</strong> If you initiate arbitration, your arbitration fees will be limited to the filing fee set forth in the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules. Unless the arbitrator finds the arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, Complect will pay all other AAA and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
              li <strong>Class and Collective Action Waiver.</strong> You and Complect mutually agree that by entering into this arbitration agreement, both waive their right to have any dispute or claim brought, heard or arbitrated as a class action and/or collective action, and an arbitrator will not have any authority to hear or arbitrate any class and/or collective action (“Class Action Waiver”). Notwithstanding any other clause contained in this arbitration agreement or the AAA Rules, as defined below, any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class and/or collective action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the class and/or collective action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration.
              li <strong>Limitation Period.</strong> In no event will any Claim, or any other action or proceeding by you (including arbitration under this Section 20(b)) be instituted more than one (1) year after the cause of action arose.
              li <strong>Enforcement.</strong> Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The United Nations Conventions on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will have no applicability.
              li <strong>Invalidity.</strong> If a court of competent jurisdiction finds the foregoing arbitration provisions invalid or inapplicable, you and Complect each agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal and State courts located in New York, New York, and you and Complect each agree to submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any applicable dispute or claim.
              li Regardless of any other terms of this arbitration agreement, claims may be brought before, and remedies awarded by, an administrative agency if applicable law permits access to such an agency notwithstanding the existence of an agreement to arbitrate governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (such as the National Labor Relations Board, the U.S. Department of Labor or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission). This arbitration agreement does not apply to any claim that may not be arbitrated as provided by an Act of Congress or lawful, enforceable presidential Executive Order.
              li This arbitration agreement is the full and complete agreement relating to the formal resolution of disputes covered by this arbitration agreement. In the event any portion of this arbitration agreement is deemed unenforceable, the remainder of this arbitration agreement will be enforceable. This arbitration agreement survives after the termination of this Agreement and/or after you cease any relationship with Complect. Notwithstanding any contrary language in any of Complect’s policies or other agreements, this arbitration agreement may not be modified or terminated absent a writing signed (electronically or otherwise) by both you and an authorized representative of Complect.

        p.fw-700 21. Additional Terms.

        p.fw-700 22. Other Terms.
        p The Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York in the United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Complect has the right to assign the Agreement and/or its rights hereunder, in whole or in part, to any third party. You do not have the right to assign the Agreement. The failure of Complect to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Agreement shall not operate as a waiver by Complect of such right or provision. The section titles in the Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The Agreement operates to the fullest extent permissible by law. If any provision of the Agreement is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision (i) is deemed severable from the Agreement and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions which shall remain in full force and effect and (ii) shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary to comply with the applicable law. Complect reserves all rights in and to the Site, including the Complect Platform and the other content posted thereon, unless otherwise expressly provided by this Agreement.  Complect reserves the right to modify or discontinue any aspect of the Complect Platform at any time without any liability to you, but will notify you of any material changes via a posting on the Site.  You consent to the use of electronic means to deliver any notices pursuant to this Agreement. Notices will be given: (a) by Complect via email (in each case to the email address that you provide when registering your account); (b) a reasonably prominent posting on the Complect Platform; or (c) by you via email to <a href="mailto:info@complect.co">info@complect.co</a>. Specialists operate as independent contractors in connection with each Project, and as employees of the Business that hires them in connection with a Full-Time Role.  This Agreement does not create an employment relationship, joint venture, partnership, or other type of business entity between you and Complect.  In no event can you represent to other persons that an employment relationship, joint venture, partnership, or other type of business entity has been formed with Complect.  You shall not represent yourself as acting as the agent or an employee of Complect.
