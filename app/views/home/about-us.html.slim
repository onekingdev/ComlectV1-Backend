          b Complect 
          | is an online platform that allows financial service firms to hire experienced compliance specialists on demand for one off projects and full time roles.

        p Financial regulatory compliance is a highly fragmented market. There are plenty of compliance consultants in the space, but no single repository for businesses to easily identify, compare, and hire them. As a third-party marketplace, we help connect businesses and compliance specialists in a discreet and confidential manner creating an agile compliance solution for the digital era.

        p We provide a project management dashboard and convenient automated invoicing and payments system to facilitate the completion of the work posted on our platform. In addition, members of our marketplace can leverage discounts for various business and regtech services through our curated partnership network.
        
        p Complect was launched in late 2017 and is based in Denver, CO.
