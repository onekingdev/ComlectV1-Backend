      <li><%= emp.name %>, <%= emp.title %>, <%= emp.department %></li>
    <% end %>
  </ul>

  <p>

    This report contains specific observations and recommendations concerning the Company’s practices, including general context and references to certain securities laws. The findings are presented in three parts: (i) identification of an any perceived weaknesses or compliance issues at <%= business.business_name %>; (ii) how the Company intends to remediate the findings noted; and (iii) an assigned risk level of low, moderate, and high. These risk ratings generally reflect a subjective assessment as to the potential regulatory risk of the finding and is not reflective of any rating or ranking system adopted by or approved by a regulator, rating agency, or other third party. The risk ratings can be understood as follows:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <span style="color: #00a746; font-weight: bold;">LOW</span> – Reflects a minor technical rule violation or recommended enhancement based on best business practices. These findings may or may not appear within a deficiency letter during the course of a regulatory examination.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="color: #ffb800; font-weight: bold;">MODERATE</span> – Reflects an area of concern that could attract more regulatory scrutiny. These findings are most likely to be commented on within a deficiency letter during the course of a regulatory examination.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">HIGH</span> – Reflects a finding of the highest level of concern and requiring immediate attention from the Company. These findings will be heavily scrutinized and may give rise to a potential enforcement action without proper additional review and remediation during the course of a regulatory examination.
    </li>
  </ul>
