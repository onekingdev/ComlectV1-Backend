    <h1>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Summary</h1>
    
    <p>
      <%= business.business_name %> (or the "Company") conducted an annual review of its compliance program from <%= annual_report.exam_start.strftime("%Y&nbsp;%B&nbsp;%d") %> through <%= Time.now.strftime("%Y&nbsp;%B&nbsp;%d") %>. <%= business.business_name %> reviews the following areas in relation to its business activities:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
      <li>Executive Summary</li>
      <li>Objectives</li>
      <li>Material Business Changes</li>
      <li>Material Regulatory Changes</li>
      <li>Findings and Recommendations</li>
      <li>Code of Ethics (the "Code") and Insider Trading</li>
      <li>Conclusion</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      <%= business.business_name %> reviewed certain books and records covering the time period from <%= annual_report.review_start.strftime("%B %d") %> through <%= annual_report.review_end.strftime("%B %d") %> (the "Review Period"). In addition, there was a review of the Company’s written policies and procedures along with documentation demonstrating their implementation. The following key employees were interviewed to gain additional insight into the Company’s operations and to compare their practices with the written policies and procedures:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <% annual_report.annual_review_employees.each do |emp| %>
        <li><%= emp.name %>, <%= emp.title %>, <%= emp.department %></li>
      <% end %>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Finally, <%= business.business_name %> analyzed the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>the Compliance Manual;</li>
      <li>Any reviews performed by the Company to evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of its compliance program; and</li>
      <li>As applicable, <%= business.business_name %>’s responses to issues noted during its prior internal reviews or issues noted during the most recent examination by the securities regulator.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Based on <%= business.business_name %>’s review, <%= business.business_name %>’s compliance program appears <%= ["poorly tailored", "reasonably tailored", "well-tailored"][annual_report.tailored_lvl-1] %> relative to the scope and nature of the Company’s operations. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <%= annual_report.comments %>
    </p>

    <p>
      This report contains specific observations and recommendations concerning the Company’s practices, including general context and references to certain securities laws. The findings are presented in three parts: (i) identification of an any perceived weaknesses or compliance issues at <%= business.business_name %>; (ii) how the Company intends to remediate the findings noted; and (iii) an assigned risk level of low, moderate, and high. These risk ratings generally reflect a subjective assessment as to the potential regulatory risk of the finding and is not reflective of any rating or ranking system adopted by or approved by a regulator, rating agency, or other third party. The risk ratings can be understood as follows:
    </p>

    <ul style="page-break-inside: avoid;">
      <li>
        <span style="color: #00a746; font-weight: bold;">LOW</span> – Reflects a minor technical rule violation or recommended enhancement based on best business practices. These findings may or may not appear within a deficiency letter during the course of a regulatory examination.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style="color: #ffb800; font-weight: bold;">MODERATE</span> – Reflects an area of concern that could attract more regulatory scrutiny. These findings are most likely to be commented on within a deficiency letter during the course of a regulatory examination.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">HIGH</span> – Reflects a finding of the highest level of concern and requiring immediate attention from the Company. These findings will be heavily scrutinized and may give rise to a potential enforcement action without proper additional review and remediation during the course of a regulatory examination.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Objectives</h1>

    <p>

      <% lines = [] %>
      <% [0, 7, 10, 16, 21, 24, 28, 32].each do |num| %>
        <% lines.push(I18n.translate("annual_report").map(&:last)[num]) %>
      <% end %>
      <% lines.each do |line| %>
